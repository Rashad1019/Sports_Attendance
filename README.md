# Analyzing College Sports Attendance Trends by Sport and Conference (2020–2024)

## 📘 Executive Summary

This project analyzes college sports attendance data from 2020 to 2024 to understand fan engagement across different sports and conferences. College athletics is a multi-billion dollar industry, and fan attendance is a key metric reflecting popularity, financial value, and growth potential. Understanding attendance patterns helps guide strategic decisions for athletic departments, conferences, marketers, and researchers.

* **Fan Engagement:** Reveals sports with strong community backing and school spirit.
* **Strategic Planning:** Informs resource allocation, event prioritization, and facility investments.
* **Gender Equity Monitoring:** Allows comparison of fan support between men's and women’s sports.

## 🧠 Key Insights (Example Questions Addressed)

* Which sport had the highest average attendance?
* Which conference was the most popular overall based on attendance?
* Were men’s sports generally more attended than women’s during this period?
